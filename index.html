      <h2>About Me</h2>
      		<p> I am a multimedia content producer whose work centers on global, community, and individual empowerment. I work primarily with non-profits, and my recent projects have taken me around the world to various parts of the United States, India, and Kenya. As a one-woman team, I produce content from initial concept to final product, a process which requires expertise in many different areas beyond photography and videography.
      		</p>
      		<p>My newest learning venture is front-end web development, a skill that will afford me more creative freedom with content production and website development. I found a part-time course at General Assembly that has proven to be so valuable already, even with only one class under my sleeve so far. I created this page as part of my course's homework assignment. Follow me as I fumble my way through this!
